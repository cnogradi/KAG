It highlights the increasing trend in fuel consumption and costs over these years, with a significant expected increase in 2014 due to the full year of US Airways operations. Additionally, the table is contextualized by information on fuel expenses for regional carriers and the company's strategies to manage fuel price and supply risks.
In 2012, fuel consumption slightly decreased to 2.723 billion gallons, but the average cost per gallon increased to $3.20, leading to higher total fuel costs of $8.717 billion, representing 35.3% of total operating expenses.

03. The table provides a detailed breakdown of fuel consumption, average cost per gallon, total fuel costs, and the percentage of total operating expenses for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. It highlights the increasing trend in fuel consumption and costs over these years, with a significant expected increase in 2014 due to the full year of US Airways operations. Additionally, the table is contextualized by information on fuel expenses for regional carriers and the company's strategies to manage fuel price and supply risks.
In 2012, fuel consumption slightly decreased to 2.723 billion gallons, but the average cost per gallon increased to $3.20, leading to higher total fuel costs of $8.717 billion, representing 35.3% of total operating expenses.

ERROR:kag.examples.finqa.solver.prompt.math_select_prompt:

1. **Understanding the Question:** The question asks for the growth of consolidated net sales in percentage from 2005 to 2007.

2. **Analyzing the Context:** The context provides net sales data for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007, along with the percentage changes from 2005 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2007.

3. **Extracting Relevant Data:**
   - Net sales in 2005: $5038 million
   - Net sales in 2006: $5400 million
   - Net sales in 2007: $7729 million
   - Percentage growth from 2005 to 2006: 7%
   - Percentage growth from 2006 to 2007: 43%

4. **Calculating the Growth from 2005 to 2007:**
   - The growth from 2005 to 2007 can be calculated by considering the cumulative effect of the growth from 2005 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2007.
   - The formula for cumulative growth is: 
     \[
     \text{Total Growth} = (1 + \text{Growth}_1) \times (1 + \text{Growth}_2) - 1
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Growth} = (1 + 0.07) \times (1 + 0.43) - 1 = 1.07 \times 1.43 - 1 = 1.5301 - 1 = 0.5301 \text{ or } 53.01\%
     \]

5. **Evaluating the Answers:**
   - All the provided answers state "I don't know," which is incorrect because the growth can be calculated using the given data.

6. **Conclusion:** Since none of the provided answers correctly calculate the growth from 2005 to 2007, the correct response is that the answers do not address the question.

**Final Answer:**

I don't know, because none of the provided answers correctly calculate the growth of consolidated net sales from 2005 to 2007.

The data illustrates how earnings are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, with both positive and negative impacts recorded in millions of dollars. The contextual information explains that the firm's risk to interest rate changes is primarily due to variations in short-term funding costs. Additionally, it mentions the role of risk managers in identifying potential losses from unusual events and the use of a system to manage and mitigate these risks.

The table presents JPMorgan Chase's 12-month pre-tax earnings sensitivity profile as of December 31, 2005, and 2004, showing the impact of immediate changes in interest rates by +200 basis points (bp), +100bp, and -100bp. The data illustrates how earnings are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, with both positive and negative impacts recorded in millions of dollars. The contextual information explains that the firm's risk to interest rate changes is primarily due to variations in short-term funding costs. Additionally, it mentions the role of risk managers in identifying potential losses from unusual events and the use of a system to manage and mitigate these risks.
This row provides the earnings sensitivity data for December 31, 2005, showing positive earnings impact for rate increases and a negative impact for a rate decrease.

05. The table presents a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. It includes various factors such as state taxes, domestic production activities deduction, changes in valuation allowances, and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which collectively influence the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the 2017 Tax Act, while in 2016, it was lower due to the release of valuation allowances.
State taxes, after accounting for federal benefits, varied each year, with the highest in 2016 and the lowest in 2017.

04. The table provides a summary of troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) in millions of dollars for the years ending December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011. It categorizes the TDRs into consumer lending, commercial lending, and specific subcategories such as nonperforming, accruing, and credit card TDRs. The table also highlights the total TDRs and the impact of regulatory changes on the consumer lending category.
Total commercial lending TDRs also saw an increase from 2011 to 2012, though less pronounced than consumer lending.
