It includes various factors such as state taxes, domestic production activities deduction, changes in valuation allowances, and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which collectively influence the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the 2017 Tax Act, while in 2016, it was lower due to the release of valuation allowances.
The effective tax rate was lowest in 2017 due to the 2017 Tax Act, while it was closer to the statutory rate in 2016 and 2015.

02. The table presents JPMorgan Chase's 12-month pre-tax earnings sensitivity profile as of December 31, 2005, and 2004, showing the impact of immediate changes in interest rates by +200 basis points (bp), +100bp, and -100bp. The data illustrates how earnings are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, with both positive and negative impacts recorded in millions of dollars. The contextual information explains that the firm's risk to interest rate changes is primarily due to variations in short-term funding costs. Additionally, it mentions the role of risk managers in identifying potential losses from unusual events and the use of a system to manage and mitigate these risks.
This row provides the earnings sensitivity data for December 31, 2005, showing positive earnings impact for rate increases and a negative impact for a rate decrease.

04. The table provides a summary of the assets and liabilities of the National City-sponsored securitization QSPEs as of December 31, 2008. It includes qualitative and quantitative information about the securitizations, focusing on credit card, automobile, and mortgage categories. The assets represent the period-end outstanding principal balances of loans transferred to the securitization QSPEs. The table also notes the specific credit card securitization series that were outstanding at that time and describes the continuing involvement in the securitized credit card receivables, including servicing and a pro-rata undivided interest in all credit card receivables.
This row presents the liabilities associated with each securitization category. The liabilities for credit card and mortgage securitizations match their respective asset values, while the automobile liabilities are equal to its assets.

12. The table presents a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. It includes various factors such as state taxes, domestic production activities deduction, changes in valuation allowances, and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which collectively influence the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the 2017 Tax Act, while in 2016, it was lower due to the release of valuation allowances.
The effective tax rate was lowest in 2017 due to the 2017 Tax Act, while it was closer to the statutory rate in 2016 and 2015.

02. The table presents the assumed weighted average health care cost trend rates over three years (2015-2017), including initial and ultimate trend rates, and the year the ultimate trend rate is expected to be reached. The contextual information explains that employer subsidies for post-65 retiree health care were frozen in 2017, and company contributions are made to a health reimbursement account. It also notes that a 1% change in health care cost trend rates would not significantly impact service and interest costs or postretirement benefit obligations.
