### [Documnt 1]
```
05. The table presents a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. It includes various factors such as state taxes, domestic production activities deduction, changes in valuation allowances, and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which collectively influence the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the 2017 Tax Act, while in 2016, it was lower due to the release of valuation allowances.
State taxes, after accounting for federal benefits, varied each year, with the highest in 2016 and the lowest in 2017.

01. The table presents the impact of a 10% change in currency exchange rates on earnings for various currencies over the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. It includes data for the real, euro, pound sterling, and Indian rupee, along with the total impact. The contextual information explains that the assumed 10% change in currency rates would not have a significant impact on earnings. Additionally, it mentions that the stronger U.S. dollar in 2012 had an unfavorable impact on revenue and operating income, and outlines the company's policy on using derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk.

06. The table presents the operating results for the space systems business segment over three years (2012, 2013, and 2014), including net sales, operating profit, operating margins, and backlog at year-end. The data is presented in millions of dollars, with operating margins also shown as percentages. The contextual information explains that the operating profit includes earnings from an investment in ULA, which provides launch services to the U.S. government. Additionally, it highlights that 2014 net sales increased by 1% compared to 2013, driven by higher sales in the Orion program and commercial space transportation, offset by lower sales in government satellite programs and other initiatives.
Backlog at year-end, showing fluctuations over the three years, with the highest value in 2013 and the lowest in 2012.

03. The table provides a summary of the assets and liabilities of the National City-sponsored securitization QSPEs as of December 31, 2008. It includes qualitative and quantitative information about the securitizations, focusing on credit card, automobile, and mortgage categories. The assets represent the period-end outstanding principal balances of loans transferred to the securitization QSPEs. The table also notes the specific credit card securitization series that were outstanding at that time and describes the continuing involvement in the securitized credit card receivables, including servicing and a pro-rata undivided interest in all credit card receivables.
This row details the assets for each category of securitization, showing the outstanding principal balances of loans transferred to the QSPEs. The credit card category has the highest value, followed by mortgage and automobile.

03. The table provides a detailed breakdown of fuel consumption, average cost per gallon, total fuel costs, and the percentage of total operating expenses for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. It highlights the increasing trend in fuel consumption and costs over these years, with a significant expected increase in 2014 due to the full year of US Airways operations. Additionally, the table is contextualized by information on fuel expenses for regional carriers and the company's strategies to manage fuel price and supply risks.
In 2012, fuel consumption slightly decreased to 2.723 billion gallons, but the average cost per gallon increased to $3.20, leading to higher total fuel costs of $8.717 billion, representing 35.3% of total operating expenses.

01. The table presents the impact of a 10% change in currency exchange rates on earnings for various currencies over the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. It includes data for the real, euro, pound sterling, and Indian rupee, along with the total impact. The contextual information explains that the assumed 10% change in currency rates would not have a significant impact on earnings. Additionally, it mentions that the stronger U.S. dollar in 2012 had an unfavorable impact on revenue and operating income, and outlines the company's policy on using derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk.

the anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of $ 21 million , coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of $ 12 million and unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $ 10 million , partially offset by other movements of $ 8 million .

the anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of $ 21 million , coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of $ 12 million and unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $ 10 million , partially offset by other movements of $ 8 million .

1. **Understanding the Question:** The question asks for the total net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year 2016.

2. **Reviewing the Chunks:**
   - **Chunk 0:** Discusses revenues for 2018, not relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 1:** Discusses other principal transactions revenues for 2018, not relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 2:** Discusses net interest income for 2018, not relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 3:** Mentions net revenues for 2017 compared to 2016, providing the total net revenues for 2017 but not directly for 2016.
   - **Chunk 4:** Discusses investment banking revenues for 2017, not directly relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 5:** Discusses investment management revenues and other revenues for 2017, not directly relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 6:** Discusses other principal transactions revenues for 2017, not directly relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 7:** Discusses net interest income for 2017, not directly relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 8:** Discusses interest income and expense for 2017, not directly relevant to 2016.
   - **Chunk 9:** Discusses provision for credit losses, not relevant to net revenues.
   - **Chunk 10:** Provides provision for credit losses for 2016, 2017, and 2018, not relevant to net revenues.
   - **Chunk 11:** Reference to a form, no specific information provided.

3. **Conclusion:** None of the chunks directly provide the total net revenues for 2016. The closest information is in **Chunk 3**, which mentions the total net revenues for 2017 and compares it to 2016, but it does not provide the exact figure for 2016.

05. The table presents the cumulative total shareholder return for Snap-On Incorporated, comparing its performance from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2013, against a peer group and the S&P 500 index. All values assume an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2008, with dividends reinvested quarterly. The data shows the growth of the investment over the five-year period for Snap-On, its peer group, and the S&P 500.
By December 31, 2012, Snap-On shows significant recovery and outperforms the peer group, though still trailing the S&P 500.
