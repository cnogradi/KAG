02. The table presents JPMorgan Chase's 12-month pre-tax earnings sensitivity profile as of December 31, 2005, and 2004, showing the impact of immediate changes in interest rates by +200 basis points (bp), +100bp, and -100bp. The data illustrates how earnings are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, with both positive and negative impacts recorded in millions of dollars. The contextual information explains that the firm's risk to interest rate changes is primarily due to variations in short-term funding costs. Additionally, it mentions the role of risk managers in identifying potential losses from unusual events and the use of a system to manage and mitigate these risks.
This row provides the earnings sensitivity data for December 31, 2005, showing positive earnings impact for rate increases and a negative impact for a rate decrease.

05. The table provides financial data for industrial packaging over three years (2004, 2005, and 2006), including sales and operating profit figures. Additionally, contextual information discusses a gain from a property sale in Spain, downtime statistics, and U.S. containerboard sales and operating profits, highlighting significant improvements in 2006 compared to previous years.
Sales data showing an increase from $4545 million in 2004 to $4925 million in 2006.

07. u.s .
containerboard net sales for 2006 were $ 955 million , compared with $ 895 million in 2005 and $ 950 million for 2004 .
average sales price realizations in the first quarter of 2006 began the year below first-quarter 2005 levels , but improved sig- nificantly during the second quarter and were higher than in 2005 for the remainder of the year .
sales volumes were higher throughout 2006 .
operating profits in 2006 were more than double 2005 levels , and 68% ( 68 % ) higher than in 2004 .
the favorable impacts of the higher average sales price realizations , higher sales volumes , reduced lack-of-order downtime and strong mill performance were only partially offset by higher input costs for freight , chemicals and energy .
```
### [Documnt 3]
```
09. operating profits in 2006 decreased 72% ( 72 % ) from 2005 and 86% ( 86 % ) from 2004 levels , primarily due to higher distribution , utility and raw material costs , and inventory adjustment charges .
european container net sales for 2006 were $ 1.0 billion , compared with $ 883 million in 2005 and $ 865 million in 2004 .
the increase was principally due to contributions from the moroccan box plants acquired in the fourth quarter of 2005 , although sales volumes for the rest of the business were also slightly higher .
```
### [Documnt 4]
```
10. operating profits in 2006 were up 31% ( 31 % ) compared with 2005 and 6% ( 6 % ) compared with 2004 .
this increase included a $ 13 million gain on the sale of property in spain as well as the increased contributions from the moroccan acquisition , parti- ally offset by higher energy costs .
international paper distribution lim- ited , our asian box and containerboard business , had net sales for 2006 of $ 182 million .
in 2005 , net sales were $ 104 million subsequent to international paper 2019s acquisition of a majority interest in august 2005 .

01. The table presents the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years 2012, 2011, and 2010. It includes data on the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations, the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units, and the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations. The context explains that diluted earnings per share calculations include the dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock units, while excluding certain stock options that would have been anti-dilutive.
Shows the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used for basic earnings per share calculations, with a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2012.

It includes data on segment net sales and operating earnings (loss), along with percentage changes. The mobile devices segment, which designs, manufactures, sells, and services wireless handsets, saw a significant decrease in net sales from 2006 to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments and limited product offerings in critical market segments.
This row details the operating earnings (loss) for the segment, showing a loss in both 2008 and 2007, with a notable improvement in 2006. The percentage change in 2008 compared to 2007 is significant, but the change for 2007 compared to 2006 is not meaningful.

12. The table presents a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. It includes various factors such as state taxes, domestic production activities deduction, changes in valuation allowances, and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which collectively influence the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2017 was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the 2017 Tax Act, while in 2016, it was lower due to the release of valuation allowances.
The effective tax rate was lowest in 2017 due to the 2017 Tax Act, while it was closer to the statutory rate in 2016 and 2015.

02. The table provides a detailed breakdown of fuel consumption, average cost per gallon, total fuel costs, and the percentage of total operating expenses for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. It highlights the increasing trend in fuel consumption and costs over these years, with a significant expected increase in 2014 due to the full year of US Airways operations. Additionally, the table is contextualized by information on fuel expenses for regional carriers and the company's strategies to manage fuel price and supply risks.
In 2011, the company consumed 2.756 billion gallons of fuel at an average cost of $3.01 per gallon, resulting in total fuel costs of $8.304 billion, which accounted for 33.2% of total operating expenses.

09. The table presents the weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plans for the years 2017 and 2016. It shows a slight decrease in the discount rate for pension plans from 2016 to 2017, while the rate for postretirement plans increased slightly over the same period. The contextual information explains that these assumptions are based on historical experience and actuarial advice, and anticipates a decrease in pre-tax pension and postretirement expenses for 2018 due to various factors including higher expected returns on assets and lower amortization costs.
