ERROR:kag.examples.finqa.solver.prompt.math_select_prompt:

1. **Understanding the Question:** The question asks for the percent increase in long-term debt due to the floating rate notes maturing in 2010.

2. **Analyzing the Context:** 
   - The context mentions that in December 2006, $250.0 floating rate notes due 2008 were exchanged for $250.0 floating rate notes due 2010.
   - The long-term debt values for 2009 and 2010 are provided as $257.0 and $240.9, respectively.

3. **Evaluating the Answers:**
   - **Answer 0:** This answer calculates the percent increase by considering the sum of the 2009 long-term debt and the $250.0 notes, then compares it to the 2010 long-term debt. The calculation is incorrect because it does not correctly reflect the change in long-term debt due to the notes maturing in 2010.
   - **Answer 1:** This answer calculates the percent increase by comparing the 2009 long-term debt to the 2010 long-term debt. The result is a negative value, indicating a decrease rather than an increase. This is incorrect because the question asks for an increase.
   - **Answer 2:** This answer calculates the percent decrease by comparing the 2009 long-term debt to the 2010 long-term debt. The result is a negative value, correctly indicating a decrease. However, the question asks for an increase, not a decrease.

4. **Conclusion:** None of the answers correctly address the question, which asks for the percent increase in long-term debt due to the floating rate notes maturing in 2010. All answers either calculate a decrease or incorrectly calculate an increase.

**Final Answer:** I don't know, because none of the answers correctly calculate the percent increase in long-term debt due to the floating rate notes maturing in 2010.

average sales price realizations in the first quarter of 2006 began the year below first-quarter 2005 levels , but improved sig- nificantly during the second quarter and were higher than in 2005 for the remainder of the year .
sales volumes were higher throughout 2006 .
operating profits in 2006 were more than double 2005 levels , and 68% ( 68 % ) higher than in 2004 .
the favorable impacts of the higher average sales price realizations , higher sales volumes , reduced lack-of-order downtime and strong mill performance were only partially offset by higher input costs for freight , chemicals and energy .

08. operating profits in 2006 decreased 72% ( 72 % ) from 2005 and 86% ( 86 % ) from 2004 levels , primarily due to higher distribution , utility and raw material costs , and inventory adjustment charges .
european container net sales for 2006 were $ 1.0 billion , compared with $ 883 million in 2005 and $ 865 million in 2004 .
the increase was principally due to contributions from the moroccan box plants acquired in the fourth quarter of 2005 , although sales volumes for the rest of the business were also slightly higher .

02. as a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate , the company has revalued its net deferred tax liability , excluding after tax credits , as of december 31 , 2017 .
based on this revaluation and other impacts of the 2017 tax act , the company has recognized a net tax benefit of $ 2.6 billion , which was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense for the year ended december 31 , 2017 .
the company has recognized provisional adjustments but management has not completed its accounting for income tax effects for certain elements of the 2017 tax act , principally due to the accelerated depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property .

05. in 2017 , the effective rate was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the 2017 tax act .
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the state apportionment impact of the illinois income tax rate change on deferred tax liabilities as well as the reclassification of income tax expense from accumulated other comprehensive income related to the disposal of bm&fbovespa shares .
in 2016 , the effective rate was lower than the statutory tax rate largely due to the release of the valuation allowances related to the sale of bm&fbovespa shares .

SubQuestion4(math): The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options in 2011 is $13.25, and in 2012 is $9.60. What is the percent change of weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options between 2011 and 2012?
Result4:
Python code is:
```python# Given values
fair_value_2011 = 13.25
fair_value_2012 = 9.60

# Calculate the percent change
percent_change = ((fair_value_2012 - fair_value_2011) / fair_value_2011) * 100

# Print the result with five decimal places
print(f"The percent change in weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options between 2011 and 2012 is: {percent_change:.5f}%")```
Execution result: The percent change in weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options between 2011 and 2012 is: -27.54717%

Result4:
Python code is:
```python# Given values
fair_value_end_2013 = 355173
fair_value_start_2013 = 377677

# Calculate growth rate
growth_rate = (fair_value_end_2013 - fair_value_start_2013) / fair_value_start_2013

# Output the result
print(f"The growth rate in total financial liabilities at fair value in 2013 is: {growth_rate:.5f}")```

the anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of $ 21 million , coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of $ 12 million and unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $ 10 million , partially offset by other movements of $ 8 million .

SubQuestion4(math): The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2005 is $8.05, and in 2006 is $6.91. What is the growth rate in the weighted average fair value for options granted between 2005 to 2006?
Result4:
Python code is:
```python# Given values
fair_value_2005 = 8.05
fair_value_2006 = 6.91

# Calculate the growth rate
growth_rate = (fair_value_2006 - fair_value_2005) / fair_value_2005

# Print the result with five decimal places
print(f"The growth rate in the weighted average fair value for options granted between 2005 to 2006 is: {growth_rate:.5f}")```
Execution result: The growth rate in the weighted average fair value for options granted between 2005 to 2006 is: -0.14161
