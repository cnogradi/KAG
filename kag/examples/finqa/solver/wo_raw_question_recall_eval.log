06. The table presents the operating results for the space systems business segment over three years (2012, 2013, and 2014), including net sales, operating profit, operating margins, and backlog at year-end. The data is presented in millions of dollars, with operating margins also shown as percentages. The contextual information explains that the operating profit includes earnings from an investment in ULA, which provides launch services to the U.S. government. Additionally, it highlights that 2014 net sales increased by 1% compared to 2013, driven by higher sales in the Orion program and commercial space transportation, offset by lower sales in government satellite programs and other initiatives.

03. The table presents the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years 2012, 2011, and 2010. It includes data on the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations, the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units, and the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations. The context explains that diluted earnings per share calculations include the dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock units, while excluding certain stock options that would have been anti-dilutive.
Provides the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used for diluted earnings per share calculations, also showing a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2012.
